i want to make a startup. 
the idea name is داروجو 
it's a platform for phramacy and people to buy their drugs more easier than now 
the platform is a website that for use, you need to login/signup as customer or pharmacy
1. as a pharmacy, you see the prescription drug list and if you have them in your pharmacy, you accept that prescription and get them ready to send. 
2. as a costumer, you insert the code and the id, if any pharmacy have you drug, they accept the prescription and tell you that we have you drugs, pay that and come to take them , 
after the accepting, the user will see the timer for prescription to be ready and available to picl up from pharmacy 
can you make this for me in html and css and js?
at first the user see the home screen, then if he or she is a customer, can sign up or login as a patient or other way if he or she is a pharmacy manager, can sign up or login as a pharmacy services
then each of them have their own page to handel the things 
for the patient side , the login page is simple with phone number and password
the sign up is easy and simple also, the name the phone number, the location (city) and a password. after seccus login or signup, the user can isnert the code and id and select the insurance type (تامین اجتماعی ، خدمات درمانی ، نیروهای مسلح ، جانبازان )
and after these just hit the search button, and if any pharmacy accept that, he or she get notified about that and after pay the money, the loading screen for prescription ready is showing with nice ui 
for the pharmacy side, the pharmacy can login with the pass and user name, the sign up page need some more info , the name of the drug store, the location the phone number the manager name. 
if some patient send a precription , the pharmacy get notified about that and after veiwing the prescription, if they have that, they accept that, and should make the prescriotion ready 

right now. the js scripts is not related to the html and css 
make that change and working for me
